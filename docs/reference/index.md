# Language Reference

This reference acts as a pseudo-specification for the Nymph programming language,
a document that describes the syntax and expected behavior of the language.

The reference should serve multiple purposes:

- Allow people unfamiliar with Nymph and its constructs to learn them
- Find bugs and inconsistencies both in the language design _and_ implementation
